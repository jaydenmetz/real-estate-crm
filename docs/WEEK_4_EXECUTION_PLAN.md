## Budget Tracking

| Item | Cost | When | Status |
|------|------|------|--------|
| Vanta Growth plan | $4,500/year | Day 1 | Pending |
| PagerDuty (free tier) | $0 | Day 3 | Pending |
| Grafana Cloud (free tier) | $0 | Day 3 | Pending |

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Vanta integration issues**

- Backup: Manual evidence collection if integration fails

**Risk 2: Vendor unresponsive (Railway SOC 2 report)**
- Mitigation: Follow up daily, escalate to account manager
- Backup: Accept ISO 27001 or equivalent certification

**Risk 3: Training completion <100%**
- Mitigation: Daily reminders, manager escalation
- Backup: Acceptable to have 80%+ by end of week, 100% by Week 5

**Risk 4: Can't reach 90% score**
- Mitigation: Focus on quick wins, defer hard items
- Backup: 85% is acceptable for Week 4, aim for 90% in Week 5
