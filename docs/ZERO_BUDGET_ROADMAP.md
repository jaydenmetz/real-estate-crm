**Current State:**
- ✅ 90% SOC 2 compliant (documentation complete)
- ✅ 88 unit tests written
- ✅ Security event logging operational
- ✅ Core CRUD functionality works

**Target State (100% Complete):**
- ✅ 95%+ test coverage (rock-solid code)
- ✅ Zero known bugs
- ✅ 100% compliance-ready (all evidence collected)
- ✅ Production-hardened (security, performance, reliability)
- ✅ Enterprise-grade codebase

**Investment:** $0
**Timeline:** Self-paced (recommend 8-12 weeks)

```javascript
// Test full request/response cycles
describe('Escrows API Integration', () => {
  it('should create escrow with authentication', async () => {
    const token = await loginUser();
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/v1/escrows')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
      .send({ /* escrow data */ });

    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body.success).toBe(true);
    expect(response.body.data).toHaveProperty('id');
  });
});
```

**Example:**
```javascript
it('should reject SQL injection in search', async () => {
  const response = await request(app)
    .get('/v1/clients?search=\'; DROP TABLE clients; --')
    .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);

  expect(response.status).toBe(200); // Should not crash
  expect(response.body.data).toEqual([]); // Should return empty, not execute
});
```

       if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
         return res.status(422).json({ errors: errors.array() });
       }
       // Process request
     }
   );
   ```

4. **Security Headers (Helmet.js - Free)**
   ```bash

3. **Session Security**
   - [ ] JWT tokens expire (15 min access, 7 day refresh)
   - [ ] Refresh tokens are rotated
   - [ ] Logout invalidates tokens
   - [ ] Concurrent login detection

4. **API Key Security**
   - [ ] API keys hashed in database (SHA-256)

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Weeks 8-9)

**Goal:** Fast, efficient, scalable code

### Week 8: Query Optimization

**Tasks:**

1. **Find Slow Queries**
   ```sql
   -- Enable query logging in PostgreSQL
   ALTER SYSTEM SET log_min_duration_statement = 100; -- Log queries >100ms

   -- Review slow query log
   SELECT query, calls, mean_exec_time, max_exec_time
   FROM pg_stat_statements
   ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
   LIMIT 20;
   ```

2. **Add Missing Indexes**
   ```sql
   -- Example: Add index for frequently queried columns
   CREATE INDEX idx_escrows_status_user ON escrows(status, user_id)
   WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

   CREATE INDEX idx_security_events_user_time ON security_events(user_id, created_at DESC);
   ```

3. **Fix N+1 Queries**
   ```javascript
   // BAD: N+1 query
   const escrows = await query('SELECT * FROM escrows WHERE user_id = $1', [userId]);
   for (const escrow of escrows) {
     escrow.client = await query('SELECT * FROM clients WHERE id = $1', [escrow.client_id]);
   }

   // GOOD: Single JOIN query
   const escrows = await query(`
     SELECT e.*, c.name as client_name, c.email as client_email
     FROM escrows e
     LEFT JOIN clients c ON e.client_id = c.id
     WHERE e.user_id = $1
   `, [userId]);
   ```

4. **Optimize Large Queries**
   - [ ] Use LIMIT/OFFSET for pagination
   - [ ] Add WHERE clauses to reduce result set
   - [ ] Use appropriate indexes
   - [ ] Avoid SELECT *, fetch only needed columns

5. **Database Connection Pooling**
   ```javascript
   // Verify pool settings
   const pool = new Pool({
     max: 20, // Maximum connections
     idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
     connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
   });
   ```

1. **Response Time Optimization**
   - [ ] Measure baseline (use `console.time()`)
   - [ ] Target: All endpoints <200ms
   - [ ] Critical endpoints <100ms

2. **Reduce Payload Sizes**
   ```javascript
   // Enable compression (gzip/brotli)
   const compression = require('compression');
   app.use(compression());

   // Paginate large responses
   app.get('/clients', async (req, res) => {
     const limit = Math.min(req.query.limit || 20, 100); // Max 100
     const offset = (req.query.page - 1) * limit;
     // Use limit/offset in query
   });
   ```

3. **Async Operations**
   - [ ] Don't block the event loop
   - [ ] Use Promise.all() for parallel operations
   - [ ] Offload CPU-intensive tasks

4. **Memory Management**
   - [ ] Fix memory leaks (use Node.js profiler)

   ```

2. **Create Compliance Scorecard**
   - [ ] Review each Trust Service Criteria (9 total)
   - [ ] List what we have (evidence)
   - [ ] List what we're missing (gaps)
   - [ ] Document acceptable workarounds (small company)

3. **Document "One-Person Company" Justifications**
   ```markdown
   ## SOC 2 Compliance - Small Company Considerations

   **Background Check Gap:**
   - Standard: Third-party background checks for all employees
   - Our Situation: Solo founder, no employees yet
   - Justification: Founder background verifiable via LinkedIn, GitHub, references
   - Mitigation: Will implement for first hire

   **Segregation of Duties Gap:**
   - Standard: Separate people for development, deployment, security
   - Our Situation: Solo founder does all roles
   - Justification: Compensating controls (extensive testing, audit logs, reviews)
   - Mitigation: Automated checks prevent single-person errors (CI/CD blocks bad code)
   ```

4. **Create Audit Narrative**
   ```markdown
   # SOC 2 Audit Narrative

   ## Company Overview
   Real estate CRM platform serving small to mid-size real estate teams.

   ## Security Posture
   - 95% test coverage (300+ automated tests)
   - Security event logging (all auth/authz events)
   - MFA enforced (100% of users)
   - Rate limiting (prevent brute force)
   - Encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)

   ## Compliance Approach
   - Automated monitoring (100+ tests, 24/7)
   - Quarterly access reviews (documented)
   - Annual policy reviews (scheduled)
   - Incident response plan (tested via tabletop)
   - Vendor management (risk assessments complete)

   ## Compensating Controls (Solo Founder)
   - Extensive test coverage (reduces human error)
   - Automated security checks (CI/CD blocks vulnerabilities)
   - Audit logging (all actions tracked)
   - Quarterly self-reviews (access, policies, risks)
   ```

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] All evidence organized by TSC
- [x] All gaps documented with justifications
- [x] Compliance scorecard shows 95%+ readiness
- [x] Audit narrative tells compelling story
