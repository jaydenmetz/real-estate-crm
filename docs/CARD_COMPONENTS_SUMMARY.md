## üìù Notes

### Database Constraints

All test data respects:
- Foreign key relationships
- Required fields
- Data type constraints
- Enum values for status fields

### Image Placeholders

Cards currently use icon placeholders:
- EscrowCard: Home icon
- ClientCard: PersonOutline icon
- ListingCard: Home icon
- AppointmentCard: Event/VideoCall/Phone icons
- LeadCard: PersonAdd icon

**Future:** Add image URLs to display actual photos

### Performance
