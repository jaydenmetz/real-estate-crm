# Enhanced Escrow Page Implementation Plan

## Current Status
Token usage: 132k/200k (66% used)
Remaining work: Create new EscrowDetail.jsx with widget-based layout

## Implementation Approach

Due to token constraints, I'll create this in phases:

### Phase 1: Core Structure (Now)
1. Create new enhanced EscrowDetail.jsx
2. Hero card with 4 stat cards + AI agent slot
3. ViewMode toggle (small/medium/large)
4. Layout grid system

### Phase 2: Category Widgets (Next)
1. Property Details widget (3 sizes)
2. Financial Details widget (3 sizes)
3. People & Contacts widget (3 sizes)
4. Timeline widget (3 sizes)
5. Checklists widget (3 sizes)

### Phase 3: Polish (Final)
1. Animations and transitions
2. Responsive design tweaks
3. Loading states
4. Error handling

## File Structure

```
frontend/src/components/
├── details/
│   └── EscrowDetail.jsx (main page - REWRITE)
├── escrow-widgets/ (NEW)
│   ├── EscrowHeroCard.jsx
│   ├── PropertyWidget.jsx
│   ├── FinancialWidget.jsx
│   ├── PeopleWidget.jsx
│   ├── TimelineWidget.jsx
│   └── ChecklistWidget.jsx
```

## Next Steps

Run this command to start implementation:
```bash
# Start with hero card
claude "Create EscrowHeroCard.jsx with 4 stat cards and AI agent slot, styled like dashboard"
```

Would you like me to:
1. Continue with full implementation (will use most remaining tokens)
2. Create in smaller commits (safer, can test between changes)
3. Generate implementation scripts you can run later
