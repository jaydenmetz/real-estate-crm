## Small Company Considerations

### Compensating Controls for Solo Founder

**Challenge:** SOC 2 assumes multi-person teams
**Solution:** Compensating controls + extensive automation

#### 1. Background Checks

**Standard Requirement:** Third-party background checks for all employees

**Our Situation:**
- Solo founder, no employees yet
- Founder background verifiable via:
  - LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/jaydenmetz
  - GitHub: https://github.com/jaydenmetz (public code history)
  - References: Available upon request

**Compensating Control:**
- Will implement background checks for first hire
- Extensive automated testing (213 tests) reduces human error
- All actions logged (security_events table)

**Justification:** Founder identity and qualifications publicly verifiable

---

#### 2. Segregation of Duties

**Standard Requirement:** Separate people for development, deployment, security

**Our Situation:**
- Solo founder performs all roles
- Same person writes code, deploys, reviews security

**Compensating Controls:**
1. **Automated Testing:** 213 tests prevent human error
2. **Pre-commit Hooks:** Code automatically validated before commit
3. **Audit Logging:** All actions tracked in security_events
4. **Quarterly Self-Reviews:** Access reviews, policy reviews documented
5. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated checks block bad code from production

**Justification:** Automation provides oversight that would normally come from separation

---

#### 3. Code Review

**Standard Requirement:** Peer code review for all changes

**Our Situation:**
- No peers to review code
- Solo developer

**Compensating Controls:**
1. **Automated Linting:** ESLint catches 200+ code quality issues
2. **Automated Testing:** 213 tests must pass before deployment
3. **Pre-commit Hooks:** Prevent bad code from being committed
4. **Static Analysis:** ESLint + Jest coverage reports

**Justification:** Automated checks provide more consistent review than human peers

---

#### 4. Training & Awareness

**Standard Requirement:** Annual security training for all employees

**Our Situation:**
- Solo founder, self-trained
- No formal training program for one person

**Compensating Control:**
- Self-certification: Reviewed OWASP Top 10, NIST guidelines, SOC 2 requirements
- Continuous learning: Security blogs, conference talks, documentation
- Implementation: All security best practices implemented in code

**Evidence:**
- SECURITY_TRAINING_CERTIFICATION.md (self-attestation)
- Security implementations in code (proof of knowledge)

**Justification:** Knowledge demonstrated through implementation, not just certification

---

## Gaps & Mitigation

### Known Gaps

1. **Background Checks** (CC1)
   - Gap: No third-party background check for founder
   - Mitigation: Publicly verifiable background (LinkedIn, GitHub)
   - Will implement: For first hire

2. **Penetration Testing** (CC9)
   - Gap: No external penetration test
   - Mitigation: 213 automated security tests, 0 known vulnerabilities
   - Will implement: Before first enterprise customer ($3-5k)

3. **APM Monitoring** (CC4)
   - Gap: No Application Performance Monitoring tool
   - Mitigation: Query logging, Railway metrics, Sentry for errors
   - Will implement: At 100 active users ($25/mo)

### No Critical Gaps

All critical security controls are implemented. Gaps listed above are:
- Low priority (background checks when hiring)
- Scale-dependent (APM at 100 users)
- Budget-dependent (pentesting before enterprise)
