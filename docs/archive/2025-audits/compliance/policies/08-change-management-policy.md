## 3. Change Classification

### 3.1 Standard Changes (Pre-Approved)
**Examples:**
- Bug fixes (non-breaking)
- Minor feature updates
- Security patches (low risk)
- Configuration updates (tested)
- Documentation updates

**Process:**

- No approval needed (pre-authorized)

### 3.2 Normal Changes (Manager Approval)
**Examples:**
- New features
- API changes (backward compatible)
- Database migrations (additive)
- Infrastructure scaling
- Integration updates

**Process:**
1. Create change request
2. Technical review
3. Manager approval
4. Deploy during approved window
5. Post-deployment verification

### 3.3 Emergency Changes (Fast-Track)
**Examples:**
- Security vulnerabilities (critical)
- Production outages
- Data corruption
- Service degradation

**Process:**
1. Immediate fix development
2. Verbal approval from CTO/CEO
3. Deploy immediately
4. Document after resolution
5. Retrospective within 24 hours

### 3.4 Major Changes (Executive Approval)
**Examples:**
- Breaking API changes
- Database schema changes (destructive)
- Infrastructure migrations
- Platform upgrades
- Major architectural changes

**Process:**
1. Detailed change proposal
2. Risk assessment
3. Rollback plan
4. Executive approval
5. Scheduled maintenance window
6. Customer notification
7. Post-change review

## 4. Change Request Process

### 4.1 Request Submission
**Required Information:**
- Change description and business justification
- Systems affected
- Implementation plan
- Rollback plan
- Testing evidence
- Risk assessment
- Estimated downtime (if any)
- Proposed deployment time

### 4.2 Review & Approval

**Technical Review:**
- Code review (2 approvals for major changes)
- Security review (for security-sensitive changes)
- Performance impact assessment
- Dependency analysis

**Approval Levels:**
- **Standard:** Automated (CI/CD)
- **Normal:** Engineering Manager
- **Emergency:** CTO/CEO (verbal OK)
- **Major:** CTO + CEO

### 4.3 Implementation

**Pre-Deployment:**
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Deployment runbook prepared
- [ ] Team notified of deployment
- [ ] Customer notification (if needed)

**Deployment:**
- [ ] Execute deployment procedure
- [ ] Monitor logs and metrics
- [ ] Verify functionality
- [ ] Update status page
- [ ] Document any issues

**Post-Deployment:**
- [ ] Smoke tests executed
- [ ] Metrics reviewed (error rates, latency)
- [ ] Customer feedback monitored
- [ ] Team notified of success
- [ ] Change ticket closed

## 5. Deployment Windows

### 5.1 Approved Times
**Standard Changes:**
- Monday-Thursday: 9am-5pm PT
- Avoid Fridays (no time to fix issues before weekend)

**Normal Changes:**
- Tuesday-Wednesday: 10am-3pm PT (lowest traffic)
- Advance notice: 24 hours

**Major Changes:**
- Scheduled maintenance windows
- Saturday 2am-6am PT (minimal user impact)
- Advance notice: 7 days minimum

**Emergency Changes:**
- Anytime (business continuity takes priority)

### 5.2 Blackout Periods
**No changes during:**
- End of month/quarter (financial close)
- Major company events
- Holiday weekends
- During active incidents

## 6. Testing Requirements

### 6.1 Mandatory Testing
**All changes require:**
- Unit tests (80%+ coverage)
- Integration tests (API endpoints)
- Manual testing (happy path + edge cases)
- Regression testing (no broken functionality)

**Major changes additionally require:**
- Load testing (performance impact)
- Security testing (vulnerability scan)
- User acceptance testing (UAT)
- Disaster recovery test (rollback works)

### 6.2 Environment Progression
1. **Local:** Developer testing
2. **CI/CD:** Automated test suite
3. **Staging:** Pre-production validation (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
4. **Production:** Live deployment

**Note:** Staging environment needed before SOC 2 audit.

## 7. Rollback Procedures

### 7.1 Rollback Triggers
Rollback if:
- Error rate increases > 5%
- Response times degrade > 50%
- Customer reports of broken functionality
- Security vulnerability introduced
- Data corruption detected

### 7.2 Rollback Process
**Code Deployments:**
```bash
# Railway automatic rollback
railway rollback --environment production

# Or manual git revert
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
# Railway auto-deploys reverted code
```

**Database Migrations:**
```bash
# Rollback migration (if reversible)
npm run migrate:rollback

# Restore from backup (if irreversible)
# 1. Stop application
# 2. Restore database from backup
# 3. Verify data integrity
# 4. Restart application
```

**Infrastructure Changes:**
- Revert configuration to previous state
- Infrastructure-as-code makes this straightforward
- Terraform/Ansible rollback procedures

## 8. Change Calendar

All changes tracked in shared calendar:
- **Change date/time**
- **Change owner**
- **Systems affected**
- **Estimated duration**
- **Risk level**
- **Approval status**

Benefits:
- Visibility for entire team
- Avoid conflicting changes
- Coordinate with other teams
- Track deployment frequency

## 9. Metrics & Reporting

### 9.1 Key Metrics
- **Change Success Rate:** % of changes without rollback
- **Mean Time to Deploy (MTTD):** Avg time from commit to production
- **Change Frequency:** Deployments per week
- **Change Failure Rate:** % of changes causing incidents
- **Rollback Rate:** % of changes requiring rollback

### 9.2 Targets
- Success rate: > 95%
- MTTD: < 1 hour (standard changes)
- Change frequency: 10+ per week
- Failure rate: < 5%
- Rollback rate: < 3%

## 10. Continuous Improvement

### 10.1 Post-Mortem Reviews
For major changes or failed changes:
- What went well?
- What went wrong?
- What could be improved?
- Action items assigned
- Follow-up in 30 days

### 10.2 Policy Review
- Quarterly review of change metrics
- Annual policy update
- Incorporate lessons learned
- Streamline approval processes where safe
