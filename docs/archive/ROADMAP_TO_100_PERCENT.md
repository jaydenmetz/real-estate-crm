## Why This Roadmap Works (Billion-Dollar Principles)

### 1. **Compliance First (Phases 1)**
Like Stripe, we get SOC 2 certified BEFORE scaling. This unlocks enterprise deals.

### 2. **Quality Over Speed (Phase 2)**
Like Amazon, we achieve 95% test coverage. This prevents the "move fast, break things" trap.

### 3. **Performance Matters (Phase 3)**
Like Google, we optimize for <100ms response times. Every 100ms delay = 1% revenue loss.

### 4. **Enterprise Features (Phase 4)**
Like Salesforce, we build SSO, RBAC, APIs. This enables $10k+ ACVs.

### 5. **Proven PMF (Phase 5)**
Like Slack, we prove product-market fit with 100 paying customers before raising/exiting.
