## ✅ Completed Actions

### Backend Structure
- Migrated to .routes.js naming convention for all routes
- Archived legacy route files to: backend/src/routes/_archived_20250809
- Established service layer structure in backend/src/services
- Moved test routes to __tests__ directory

### Frontend Structure  
- Consolidated debug components to single DebugCard component
- Updated all component imports
- Migrated to single API service pattern

### File Organization
- **Routes:** All using .routes.js convention
- **Controllers:** Maintained .controller.js convention
- **Services:** Established .service.js pattern
- **Models:** Using .model.js convention

## 📂 New Structure

│   └── common/
│       └── DebugCard.jsx  # Single debug component
├── services/
│   └── api.js      # Single API service
└── [other directories...]
```

## 🔄 Updated Files
- app.js: Now uses .routes.js files exclusively
- All component imports updated to use DebugCard
- API imports consolidated to services/api

## 📋 Next Steps
1. Test all endpoints to ensure routing works
2. Implement service layer methods for business logic
3. Remove archived files after confirming stability
4. Update documentation

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- Backup created at: backend/src/routes/_archived_20250809
- Old files archived, not deleted (can be restored if needed)
- Test thoroughly before removing archived files
