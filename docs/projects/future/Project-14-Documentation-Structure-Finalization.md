**Phase**: A
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Time**: 6 hours
**Started**: [Date]
**Completed**: [Date]

## 🎯 Goal
Finalize documentation structure following the October 14, 2025 cleanup guidelines - keep only active reference docs in /docs, archive completed/obsolete docs, and ensure no duplicate information.

## 📋 Context
After the major documentation cleanup on October 14, 2025, this project ensures the structure remains clean and all documentation follows the established philosophy: active reference only, no duplicate info, archive completed plans.

**Current State:**
- 9 essential active docs in /docs
- Archive system in place at /docs/archive
- Project system in /docs/projects

**Target:**
- Maintain clean 9-doc core
- Ensure all docs are current and accurate
- No obsolete information
- Clear archive structure

## ✅ Tasks

### Planning
- [ ] Review all 9 active docs for accuracy
- [ ] Check for any obsolete information
- [ ] Verify no duplicate content across docs
- [ ] Review archive folder organization
- [ ] Identify any missing critical documentation

### Implementation
- [ ] Update outdated sections in active docs
- [ ] Remove duplicate information
- [ ] Consolidate overlapping content
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting across docs
- [ ] Update cross-references between docs
- [ ] Organize archive by year and category
- [ ] Create clear naming conventions for archived docs

### Testing
- [ ] Verify all links in docs work
- [ ] Check all code examples are current
- [ ] Ensure screenshots/diagrams are up-to-date
- [ ] Test that docs match actual implementation

### Documentation
- [ ] Update docs/README.md with structure guide
- [ ] Add "Last Updated" dates to all active docs
- [ ] Create archive index
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md documentation section

## 🧪 Simple Verification Tests

### Test 1: Only Essential Docs in /docs
**Steps:**
1. Run: `ls /Users/jaydenmetz/Desktop/real-estate-crm/docs/*.md | wc -l`
2. Verify count matches expected active docs

**Expected Result:** Approximately 9-12 active reference docs (core essentials)

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Test 2: No Duplicate Information
**Steps:**
1. Search for "JWT authentication" across all docs
2. Verify info appears in only one authoritative doc
3. Other docs reference that authoritative source

**Expected Result:** No duplicate explanations of same concepts

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Test 3: All Links Work
**Steps:**
1. Run: `grep -r "\[.*\](.*\.md)" docs/*.md`
2. Test each internal link resolves
3. Check for broken references

**Expected Result:** All internal doc links work correctly

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Test 4: Archive Is Organized
**Steps:**
1. Run: `ls docs/archive/`
2. Verify folders exist: 2025-plans/, 2025-audits/, design-specs/, superseded/
3. Check files are in appropriate categories

**Expected Result:** Archive has clear category structure

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]
