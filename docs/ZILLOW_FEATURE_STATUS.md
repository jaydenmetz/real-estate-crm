# Zillow Feature Deployment Status

## âœ… Completed in Production Database
1. Added `zillow_url` column to escrows table
2. Set Zillow URL for ESCROW-2025-0001
3. Recorded migration 022_add_zillow_url_to_escrows.sql

## ðŸš€ Waiting for Backend Deployment
The following changes are pushed to main branch and waiting for Railway auto-deployment:
- Updated escrows controller to include `zillowUrl` in API responses
- Added link preview endpoint `/api/v1/link-preview`
- Added cheerio dependency for Open Graph parsing

## âœ… Frontend Already Deployed
The frontend changes are live and will work once backend is deployed:
- Shows ZillowPreview component when escrow has `zillowUrl`
- Displays image-only preview as requested
- Falls back to escrow property image if Zillow blocks requests

## ðŸ“‹ To Verify Deployment

1. Check if backend is deployed:
```bash
curl https://api.jaydenmetz.com/api/v1/escrows/ESCROW-2025-0001 | jq '.zillowUrl'
```

2. Test link preview endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.jaydenmetz.com/api/v1/link-preview \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/6510-Summer-Breeze-Ln-Bakersfield-CA-93313/19056207_zpid/"}'
```
