# Phase 1 Completion Report: Multi-Tenant Database Schema

**Completed:** October 22, 2025
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Status:** ‚úÖ 100% Complete (12/12 migrations successful)

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

Phase 1 database migrations are complete. The database now supports:
- Multi-broker hierarchy (brokers ‚Üí teams ‚Üí users)
- Data ownership tracking (owner_id on all core tables)
- Privacy for leads (is_private flag + appointments inherit privacy)
- Permission system (global + per-resource)
- Full-text search (pg_trgm for 1M+ users)
- KPI tracking infrastructure

**Your app is still running normally** - these are additive changes that don't break existing code.

## üîê Privacy Model (Implemented)

### Always Visible to Broker (No Privacy)
‚úÖ **Escrows** - Compliance/production tracking
‚úÖ **Clients** - Database asset
‚úÖ **Listings** - Inventory management

**Reason:** Broker needs visibility for regulatory compliance and brokerage management.

### Can Be Private (Agent Controlled)
üîí **Leads** - Agent can mark as private (is_private = TRUE)
üîí **Appointments** - Inherit privacy from linked lead (via lead_id)

**Reason:** Agent owns their personal prospecting (family, friends, cold calls).

### System Admin (You)
üîì **Sees Everything** - Including all private data (for support/debugging)

---

## üöÄ What Works Right Now

‚úÖ **Your app still works normally** - These are additive changes
‚úÖ **Database ready for multi-broker support**
‚úÖ **Ownership tracked on all core tables**
‚úÖ **Privacy infrastructure in place**
‚úÖ **Full-text search ready (1M+ users)**
‚úÖ **KPI tracking tables created**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Doesn't Work Yet (Needs Phase 2)

‚ùå **Authorization checks** - Controllers don't enforce ownership yet
‚ùå **Privacy filtering** - Queries don't hide private leads from broker yet
‚ùå **Permission enforcement** - Backend doesn't check user_permissions yet
‚ùå **Scope filtering** - No broker/team/user scope queries yet
‚ùå **KPI calculations** - agent_kpis table exists but no data populated
‚ùå **Notifications** - broker_notification_settings table exists but no events sent

**These will be built in Phase 2.**

---

## üìã Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Week 1: Authorization Middleware
**Goal:** Enforce ownership and privacy at the controller level

**Tasks:**
1. Create `/backend/src/middleware/authorization.middleware.js`
   - `canAccessScope(req, res, next)` - Check if user can access broker/team/user scope
   - `requireOwnership(req, res, next)` - Verify user owns resource
   - `requirePermission(permission)` - Check user_permissions table

2. Create `/backend/src/services/ownership.service.js`
   - `canAccessResource(userId, resourceType, resourceId)` - Check ownership + privacy
   - `canModifyResource(userId, resourceType, resourceId)` - Check edit permissions
   - `canDeleteResource(userId, resourceType, resourceId)` - Check delete permissions

3. Update all controllers to use new middleware:
   ```javascript
   // Before (Phase 1)
   router.get('/escrows', escrowsController.getAll);

   // After (Phase 2)
   router.get('/escrows', canAccessScope, escrowsController.getAll);
   ```

4. Update all queries to filter by ownership:
   ```javascript
   // Before (Phase 1)
   SELECT * FROM escrows WHERE team_id = $1

   // After (Phase 2)
   SELECT * FROM escrows
   WHERE (owner_id = $1 OR team_id = $2)
     AND ($3 = 'system_admin' OR is_private = FALSE)
   ```

**Estimated time:** 3-4 days

---

### Week 2: Admin UI Components
**Goal:** Build system_admin entity selector and broker dashboard

**Tasks:**
1. Create `/frontend/src/components/admin/AdminEntitySelector.jsx`
   - Dropdown to select broker, team, or user
   - Fuzzy search with pg_trgm indexes
   - Supports 1M+ users

2. Create `/frontend/src/components/broker/BrokerDashboard.jsx`
   - Brokerage-wide KPIs (total production)
   - Team-level KPIs (by team comparison)
   - Individual agent KPIs (performance cards)
   - Agent performance cards

3. Create `/frontend/src/components/broker/AgentPerformanceCard.jsx`
   - Lead metrics (total, new, conversion rate)
   - Appointment metrics (scheduled, completed, show rate)
   - Production metrics (escrows, volume, commission)
   - Last activity timestamp

4. Add broker notification bell to header
   - Real-time alerts for escrow/client/listing created
   - WebSocket integration

**Estimated time:** 3-4 days

---

### Week 3: KPI Service & Notification Service
**Goal:** Populate agent_kpis table and send broker notifications

**Tasks:**
1. Create `/backend/src/services/kpi.service.js`
   - `calculateMonthlyKPIs(userId, startDate, endDate)` - Aggregate metrics
   - `refreshKPIs()` - Nightly cron job to update agent_kpis table

2. Create `/backend/src/services/notification.service.js`
   - `notifyBroker(brokerId, eventType, data)` - Send notification
   - Integrate with WebSocket for real-time alerts
   - Check broker_notification_settings before sending

3. Add notification hooks to controllers:
   ```javascript
   // In escrows.controller.js
   const newEscrow = await Escrow.create(req.body);
   await NotificationService.notifyBroker(user.broker_id, 'escrow.created', newEscrow);
   ```

4. Build broker notification preferences page

**Estimated time:** 2-3 days

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Before Phase 2

1. **Verify existing app still works:**
   - Login as admin@jaydenmetz.com
   - Create/edit/delete escrows, clients, listings, leads
   - Confirm no errors

2. **Check database integrity:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE broker_id IS NOT NULL; -- Should be 2
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM escrows WHERE owner_id IS NOT NULL; -- Should be 29
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leads WHERE is_private = TRUE; -- Should be 0 (none marked private yet)
   ```

3. **Test full-text search:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE (first_name || ' ' || last_name) ILIKE '%jayden%'; -- Should be fast
   ```

### After Phase 2

1. **Test ownership filtering:**
   - Login as agent, verify only see own + team data
   - Login as broker, verify see all non-private data
   - Login as system_admin, verify see everything

2. **Test privacy:**
   - Mark lead as private
   - Login as broker, verify can't see private lead
   - Login as system_admin, verify can still see private lead

3. **Test permissions:**
   - Grant can_delete to agent
   - Verify agent can delete team resources
   - Revoke permission, verify can no longer delete
