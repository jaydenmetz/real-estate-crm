# Module Completion Template

**Purpose:** Complete checklist for each module (Escrows, Listings, Clients, Appointments, Leads) to ensure nothing is forgotten.

**Approach:** Start with Escrows to create the perfect template, then replicate to all other modules.

- [ ] Sort working (by date, price, status, name)
- [ ] Bulk actions (select multiple, bulk delete, bulk update status)
- [ ] Loading states (skeletons while data fetches)
- [ ] Empty states (friendly message when no data)
- [ ] Error states (retry button, error message)

### 1.2 Dashboard Data Display

- [ ] All inspection reports uploaded
- [ ] All title documents uploaded (prelim report, final policy)
- [ ] All commission documents uploaded (invoices, receipts)
- [ ] File naming conventions consistent (e.g., "123_Main_St_Purchase_Agreement.pdf")
- [ ] Files organized in folders if applicable

### 3.3 Contacts Linked

---

## Phase 4: Backend - APIs, Database, Logic

### 4.1 Database Schema
- [ ] Table created with all required fields
- [ ] Foreign keys set up (links to clients, listings, users)
- [ ] Indexes created for performance (escrow_number, property_address, status, created_at)
- [ ] Constraints enforced (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- [ ] Default values set where applicable
- [ ] Timestamps (created_at, updated_at, deleted_at) working

### 4.2 API Endpoints
- [ ] **GET /v1/escrows** - List all with filters, pagination, search
- [ ] **GET /v1/escrows/:id** - Get single record
- [ ] **POST /v1/escrows** - Create new record
- [ ] **PUT /v1/escrows/:id** - Update record
- [ ] **DELETE /v1/escrows/:id** - Soft delete record
- [ ] **GET /v1/escrows/stats** - Dashboard statistics
- [ ] **POST /v1/escrows/:id/documents** - Upload file
- [ ] **DELETE /v1/escrows/:id/documents/:fileId** - Delete file
- [ ] All endpoints require authentication
- [ ] All endpoints support both JWT and API key auth
- [ ] All endpoints return consistent response format

### 4.3 API Validation
- [ ] Input validation on all POST/PUT endpoints
- [ ] Error messages clear and actionable
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (input sanitization)
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled (prevent abuse)

### 4.4 Business Logic
- [ ] Commission calculations accurate
- [ ] Status transitions validated (can't go from Closed back to Pending)
- [ ] Date validations (closing date can't be before opening date)
- [ ] Duplicate detection (prevent duplicate escrow numbers)
- [ ] Cascade deletes (delete escrow → delete related documents/tasks)

## Phase 5: Frontend - Components, Services, State

### 5.1 Folder Structure
```
/frontend/src
  /components
    /dashboards
      /escrows
        /index.jsx (main dashboard component)
        /EscrowsGrid.jsx (grid view)
        /EscrowsList.jsx (list view)
        /EscrowsTable.jsx (table view)
        /EscrowsCalendar.jsx (calendar view)
    /details
      /escrows
        /index.jsx (main detail component)
        /EscrowHero.jsx (hero section)

  /services
    /escrows.service.js (API calls)
  /hooks
    /useEscrows.js (React Query hooks)
```

### 5.2 Services Layer
- [ ] **escrows.service.js** created with all API methods
- [ ] Uses apiInstance for centralized auth
- [ ] Error handling with try/catch
- [ ] Success/error toasts
- [ ] Sentry error tracking

### 5.3 React Query Hooks
- [ ] **useEscrows()** - List escrows with filters
- [ ] **useEscrow(id)** - Get single escrow
- [ ] **useCreateEscrow()** - Create mutation
- [ ] **useUpdateEscrow()** - Update mutation
- [ ] **useDeleteEscrow()** - Delete mutation
- [ ] Cache invalidation on mutations
- [ ] Optimistic updates where appropriate

### 5.4 Component Reusability
- [ ] Shared widgets (EscrowCard, EscrowRow) used across views
- [ ] Shared forms (EscrowForm) for create/edit
- [ ] Shared modals (ConfirmDelete, EscrowModal)
- [ ] Consistent styling (use styled components or MUI theme)

---

## Phase 6: WebSocket Real-Time Sync

### 6.1 Backend WebSocket
- [ ] WebSocket server running (socket.io)
- [ ] Authentication required for WebSocket connections
- [ ] Room/channel per entity type (escrows room)
- [ ] Emit events on create/update/delete
- [ ] Error handling and reconnection logic

### 6.2 Frontend WebSocket
- [ ] **websocket.service.js** connects on app load
- [ ] Subscribes to escrows channel
- [ ] Listens for events (escrow.created, escrow.updated, escrow.deleted)
- [ ] Invalidates React Query cache on events
- [ ] Shows toast notification ("John Doe updated Escrow #123")
- [ ] Handles reconnection gracefully

### 6.3 Real-Time Features Working
- [ ] User A edits escrow → User B sees update immediately
- [ ] User A creates escrow → User B's dashboard updates
- [ ] User A deletes escrow → User B's dashboard removes it
- [ ] Multi-user collaboration doesn't cause conflicts

---

## Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance

### 7.1 Automated Tests
- [ ] **Backend tests** (escrows.controller.test.js)
  - Test all CRUD operations
  - Test validation (missing fields, invalid data)
  - Test authentication (401 without token)
  - Test authorization (can't edit other team's escrows)
- [ ] **Frontend tests** (if applicable)
  - Test component rendering
  - Test user interactions (click, type, submit)

### 7.2 Manual Testing
- [ ] Create new escrow (all fields, save, verify in database)
- [ ] Edit existing escrow (change fields, save, verify update)
- [ ] Delete escrow (confirm modal, delete, verify soft delete)
- [ ] Upload document (file uploads, preview works, download works)
- [ ] Link contacts (search contacts, link, verify in detail page)
- [ ] Complete checklist (check boxes, auto-progress, verify)
- [ ] Test all filters (status, date range, agent, etc.)
- [ ] Test search (finds escrows by address, client name)
- [ ] Test pagination (navigate pages, verify data loads)

### 7.3 Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty state (no escrows, friendly message)
- [ ] Error state (API fails, retry button works)
- [ ] Loading state (skeleton/spinner shows while loading)
- [ ] Long text (addresses/names don't overflow)
- [ ] Special characters (apostrophes, quotes in names)
- [ ] Large files (upload 10MB+ file, doesn't crash)
- [ ] Concurrent edits (two users edit same escrow, last save wins with warning)

---

## Phase 8: Documentation

### 8.1 Code Documentation
- [ ] API endpoints documented (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Database schema documented (column descriptions, relationships)
- [ ] Component props documented (JSDoc comments)
- [ ] Service methods documented (parameters, return values)

### 8.2 User Documentation
- [ ] How to create an escrow (screenshots, step-by-step)
- [ ] How to upload documents
- [ ] How to complete checklist
