# Fix Railway Authentication Issues

## Problem
After Railway redeployment, authentication is failing because:
1. JWT_SECRET environment variable might not be set
2. Username field is missing from auth responses

## Solution

### 1. Set Environment Variables on Railway

In your Railway project dashboard:

```bash
# Required Environment Variables
JWT_SECRET=279fffb2e462a0f2d8b41137be7452c4746f99f2ff3dd0aeafb22f2e799c1472
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
NODE_ENV=production

# Frontend URL (update to your actual frontend URL)
FRONTEND_URL=https://crm.jaydenmetz.com
```

### 2. Database Migration for Username

If usernames are missing, run this SQL in Railway's PostgreSQL:

```sql
-- Update existing users with username based on email
UPDATE users 
SET username = LOWER(SPLIT_PART(email, '@', 1))
WHERE username IS NULL;

-- For the admin user specifically
UPDATE users 
SET username = 'admin'
WHERE email = 'admin@jaydenmetz.com';
```

### 3. Test Authentication

Run the test script:
```bash
cd backend/scripts
npm install axios
node test-railway-auth.js
```

### 4. Frontend Fix

The frontend has been updated to properly display usernames in:
- Profile preview buttons
- Public profile URLs
- User navigation menu

### 5. Public Profile Access

Public profiles are now accessible without authentication at:
```
https://crm.jaydenmetz.com/profile/{username}
```

All other routes remain protected and require authentication.
